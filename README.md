# Image Fallover Template

##About the Project

This is a sample web-app demonstrating the concept of image fade over

that is, if you click on a specific image, it will highlight it and set it to centre of the page,

and if clicked once again, it will return to it's original state.

##Instructions

Simply run the ```image.html``` web-page in your browser.
